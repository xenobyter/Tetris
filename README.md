# Tetris

This is an attempt to learn JavaScript and Vue.js while implementing a minimal Tetris. 

## Setup

This project doesn't need a setup for now. One can use `npm install` for linting.

## Contributions
As this project has a focus on learning some new, well new for me, Language, it must be very unlikely for someone to even bother to contribute. Nevertheless any contributions are welcome. Feel free to comment or open a PR.
