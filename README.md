# Tetris

This is an attempt to learn JavaScript and Vue.js while implementing a minimal Tetris. 

## Setup

This project doesn't need a setup for now. One can use `npm install` to
*  install eslint for linting and
*  install live- server
 
## Test
You can try Tetris by either
* using `npm run serve` to open it in your local browser,
* clicking this [link](https://xb-tetris.netlify.app/) for the online version,
* uploading *.html, *.js und *.css to any webserver.

## Contributions
As this project has a focus on learning some new, well new for me, Language, it must be very unlikely for someone to even bother to contribute. Nevertheless any contributions are welcome. Feel free to comment or open a PR.
